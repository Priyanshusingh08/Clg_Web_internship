        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Priyanshu Singh, a passionate and dedicated student hailing from the vibrant city of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. Currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) from Kiet Group of Institutions, I bring a solid foundation in computer science, backed by a Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA) from BBD University.

            Throughout my academic journey, I've honed both theoretical knowledge and hands-on technical skills in various programming languages and tools. My educational background has equipped me with the expertise to tackle complex challenges in the realm of computer science.
            
            Adding practical depth to my learning, I embarked on a 6-month internship journey in an organization. This invaluable experience exposed me to the intricacies of the industry, allowing me to witness firsthand how theoretical concepts translate into real-world solutions. During this stint, I learned the art of effective collaboration, honed my communication skills, and developed the resilience to thrive under pressure.
            
            I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to the world of technology and innovation. Join me on this journey as I continue to explore, learn, and make a positive impact in the ever-evolving field of computer science.</p>
